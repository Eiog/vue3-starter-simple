      Setup
      After adding this plugin, start the dev server (usually npm run dev) to generate the first version of the types at typed-router.d.ts which should be added to your tsconfig.json along with unplugin-vue-router/client to types and "moduleResolution": "Bundler". This is what it should look like:
    </p>
    <n-button @click="() => router.push('/find/one')">
      One
    </n-button>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped lang='less'>

<route lang='yaml'>

  layout: default
  title:
</route>
